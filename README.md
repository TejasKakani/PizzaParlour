# C++ Circular Queue Implementation

This repository contains a C++ implementation of a queue data structure. The queue is used to manage orders in a restaurant setting.

## Classes

- `Orders`: This class represents an order with an `order_id` and `order_name`.
- `Queue`: This class represents a queue data structure, with methods to enqueue, dequeue, check if the queue is empty or full, and get the front and rear orders.

## Usage

To use this program:

1. Compile the `main.cpp` file.
2. Run the compiled file.

The `main` function creates a `Queue` object and enqueues several orders. It then dequeues some orders, displays the front and rear orders, and displays all orders in the queue.
